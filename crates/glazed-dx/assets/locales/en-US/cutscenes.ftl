hello-world = Hello, { $player }!
intro-a = 
  Greetings, and welcome to the world of Pokémon!
  My name is Professor Willow. Some people happen to call me the Pokémon Professor. I study Pokémon for a living! With my research, we can learn all about these mysterious creatures.
intro-b = This little Pokémon, for example, is a { bulbasaur-species }. There are hundreds of other Pokémon out there, all different than the next. That's what captivates old-timers like me to study them, and youngsters like yourself to battle with them.
intro-c = While we're on the topic, please tell me a little about yourself. Don't be shy!
